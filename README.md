# Tower-of-Hanoi-ARM-
Code written using ARMv7 to solve the tower of hanoi problem
Tower of Hanoi Recursive Algorithm â€“ ARM Assembly (Fall 2024)
Implemented a recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem using ARM Assembly language and a full-descending stack model.
Designed and tested stack operations with manual memory management, using PUSH/POP instructions for register preservation and function recursion.
Managed call stack manually to simulate recursive logic flow, base case evaluation, and disk movement across pegs.
Demonstrated strong understanding of low-level computation, memory addressing, and ARM architecture conventions.
Validated solution through simulation and register snapshot analysis, ensuring correct recursive flow and stack pointer behavior.
